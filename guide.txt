   2. type sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

Done! You now have NodeJS installed on your PC, Laptop or VPS.

Now, you have to install the required packages for the bot to run.

Steps:
1. Open the folder that Hyper is in

 FOR WINDOWS USERS:
  2. open a command prompt or a power shell in that folder
  3. type this in it: npm i discord.js ms fs moment mc-hermes memejs --save
  4. wait a few minutes for it to install all the packages

 FOR LINUX USERS:

  4. wait a few minutes for it to install all the packages

 FOR MAC USERS:
  2. open a terminal
  3. type this in it: npm i discord.js ms fs moment mc-hermes memejs --save
  4. wait a few minutes for it to install all the packages

Alright, we now have the packages installed. Now, let's set the bot up.
Note: don't close the command propmt, folder or terminal!

We now need a bot token!
How to get that:
1. go to https://discordapp.com/developers/
2. click on "My Apps"
3. click on New App
4. enter a name for the application (your bot), and optional, add a description and set it an avatar
5. click on create app
6. scroll down untill you see the "Bot" section, and then click on "Create a Bot User"
7. now, you can see a line that says "Token: click to reveal". Click on "click to reveal", and then copy the text that appeared.

!!!  W A R N I N G  !!!

Your bot's token is meant to be SECRET.
It is the way by which your bot authenticates with the Discord server in the same way that you login to Discord with a username and password.
Revealing your token is like putting your password on the internet, and anyone that gets this token can use your bot connection to do things.
Like delete all the messages on your server and ban everyone.
If your token ever reaches the internet, change it immediately.
This includes putting it on pastebin/hastebin, having it in a public github repository, displaying a screenshot of it, anything.

!!! END OF  W A R N I N G  !!!

8. now, enter in the directory that Hyper is in, click on Storage and then click on config.json and on the token line, replace your-token with the token you copied
   from the developers panel. make sure to save it!!

Good. Now Hyper is ready to go!

Now, you can customize Hyper! To customize Hyper, you must enter
in the Storage folder and then open config.json.

In there, you have a few lines:
1. token = your bot's token
   default value: "your-token"
2. prefix = general bot's prefix
   default value: "h!"
3. version = bot's version (please do not edit, that will be edited by the bot's developer)
   default value: "2.1" (this will be updated when you download updates from MCM)
4. logging = when you have logging on true, all the commands executed by users will be logged into the terminal / command prompt. To turn it off, change true to false.
   default value: true
5. color = the preffered color for embeds
   default value: "BLUE"
   supported colors: BLUE, RED, YELLOW, BLACK, WHITE, MAGENTA, PURPLE, PINK, GREEN, CYAN, GRAY.
6. lang = the preffered language (only en-US and RO are available right now)
   default value: "en-US"

You can also customize Hyper by customizing the messages!
Enter in the messages folder and then click on edit on your actual or preffered language.

Well, this is the end of the guide! Please note
